Model Application Field(s):                               |  Robotics
Describe the life critical impact (if present).   |  Not Applicable
(For GPAI Models): Description of methods implemented in data acquisition or processing, if any, to address other types of potentially harmful data in the training, testing, and validation data: | Not GPAI
(For GPAI Models): Description of any methods implemented in data acquisition or processing, if any, to address illegal or harmful content in the training data, including, but not limited to, child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) | Not GPAI
Use Case Restrictions:                              |  Abide by [NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/enterprise-software/nvidia-open-model-license/)
Model and dataset restrictions:            |  The Principle of least privilege (PoLP) is applied limiting access for dataset generation and model development.  Restrictions enforce dataset access during training, and dataset license constraints adhered to.
