## Model Architecture:

**Architecture Type:** Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model


**Network Architecture:**

``mindmap`` is a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model that samples robot trajectories conditioned on sensor observations and a 3D reconstruction of the environment. Images are first passed through a Vision Foundation Model and then back-projected, using the depth image, to a pointcloud. In parallel, a reconstruction of the scene is built that accumulates metric-semantic information from past observations. The two 3D data sources, the instantaneous visual observation and the reconstruction, are passed to a transformer that iteratively denoises robot trajectories.

**This model was developed based on:** [3D Diffuser Actor](https://3d-diffuser-actor.github.io/)

**Number of model parameters:** ∼3M trainable, plus ∼100M frozen in the image encoder

## Model Limitations:

This model is not tested or intended for use in mission critical applications that require functional safety. The use of the model in those applications is at the user's own risk and sole responsibility, including taking the necessary steps to add needed guardrails or safety mechanisms.

- Risk: This policy is only effective on the exact simulation environment it was trained on.
    - Mitigation: Need to retrain the model on new simulation environments.
- Risk: The policy was never tested on a physical robot and likely only works in simulation
    - Mitigation: Expand training, testing and validation on physical robot platforms.

## Ethical Considerations:

NVIDIA believes Trustworthy AI is a shared responsibility and we have established policies and practices to enable development for a wide array of AI applications.  When downloaded or used in accordance with our terms of service, developers should work with their internal model team to ensure this model meets requirements for the relevant industry and use case and addresses unforeseen product misuse.
